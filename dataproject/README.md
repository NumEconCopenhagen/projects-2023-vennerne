Our project is titled Daily COVID-19 infection rates and populations and concerns the connection between infections and the population size of Danish municipalities.

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. SMIT4.csv Danmarks statistik

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
